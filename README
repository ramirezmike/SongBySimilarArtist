Script launches from terminal with an artist's name as the argument which is used to generate a list of similar artists. The script previously launched Firefox, but a recent update to Firefox broke the script's compatability with Watir, the Ruby framework I use to control the browser. I switched to Chrome and it works with the latest version. The script automatically adds and plays random songs through Grooveshark. 

Once launched, both the terminal window and the chrome window can be minimized and the script continues to run and control the minimized chrome window.


Bugs to fix: 
* (FIXED)Changed the function call to fit Grooveshark's new javascript API changes
* (FIXED)sometimes an artist name will crash the script because of encoding
* (FIXED)timing of adding songs needs to be balanced
* (FIXED)time from script launch to music playing should be shortened
* (FIXED)urls sometimes crash the script because of encoding
* (FIXED)crashes if an artist in list has no song results from Tinysong
* (FIXED)Nickelback songs sometimes play

Features to add:
* Some way to control the music; i.e., pause, skip

How to run:

You'll need the latest version of Chrome
Python with BeautifulSoup and pexpect libraries installed
watir installed on your system
API keys from last.fm and tinysong *please don't take mine if I've forgotten to remove them :(*
