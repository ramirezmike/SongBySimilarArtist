Script launches from terminal with an artist's name as the argument which is used to generate a list of similar artists. The script launches Firefox and automatically adds and plays random songs through Grooveshark. 

Once launched, both the terminal window and the firefox window can be minimized and the script continues to run and control the minimized firefox window.

Bugs to fix: 
* (FIXED)sometimes an artist name will crash the script because of encoding
* (FIXED)timing of adding songs needs to be balanced
* (FIXED)time from script launch to music playing should be shortened
* (FIXED)urls sometimes crash the script because of encoding
* (FIXED)crashes if an artist in list has no song results from Tinysong
* (FIXED)Nickelback songs sometimes play
* Won't play on launch if the first song has incompatible encoding in the URL
	- just need to implement some recursion to fix this

Features to add:
* Some way to control the music; i.e., pause, skip

How to run:

You'll need Firefox with the "noscripts" addon installed.
Python with BeautifulSoup and pexpect libraries installed
watir installed on your system
API keys from last.fm and tinysong *please don't take mine if I've forgotten to remove them :(*
