Script launches from terminal with an artist's name as the argument which is used to generate a list of similar artists. The script launches Firefox and automatically adds and plays random songs through Grooveshark. 

Once launched, both the terminal window and the firefox window can be minimized and the script continues to run and control the minimized firefox window.

Bugs to fix: 
* (FIXED)sometimes an artist name will crash the script because of encoding
* timing of adding songs needs to be balanced
* time from script launch to music playing should be shortened
* (FIXED)crashes if an artist in list has no song results from Tinysong
* (FIXED)Nickelback songs sometimes play

How to run:

You'll need Firefox with the "noscripts" addon installed.
Python with BeautifulSoup and pexpect libraries installed
watir installed on your system
API keys from last.fm and tinysong
